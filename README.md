# Moment Distribution Calculator

### Single-page web application to assist Civil Engineering students with Moment Distribution calculations.


## Installation

-Download 'single_page_app' folder to any folder on your computer.

-Open 'index.html' in a browser of your choice by double-clicking on it.

Note that this hasn't been extensively tested in many browsers and browser versions, but it should work in (almost) any browser (I hope).
Maybe keep away from Internet Explorer versions < 9;

Short video with (very) quick overview of how to use it:

If you're a Civil Engineering student and want to use this,
the video uses an example structure to (hastily) show how to use it.
