# Moment Distribution Calculator

### Single-page web application to assist students with Moment Distribution calculations.


### Installation

For now, only the JavaScript implementation is complete, so:
- [Click here: Moment Distribution Calculator - JavaScript.zip](https://github.com/ClintonMag/moment-distribution/blob/master/Moment%20Dist%20Calculator%20-%20JavaScript.zip)
- Click on the "Download" button on the right.
- Extract to any folder on your computer.
- Open "index.html" in a browser of your choice by double-clicking on it.

Note that this hasn't been extensively tested in many browsers and browser versions, but it should work in (almost) any browser (I hope).
Maybe keep away from Internet Explorer versions < 9;

Short video with (very) quick overview of how to use it:

If you're a Civil Engineering student and want to use this,
the video uses an example structure to (hastily) show how to use it.
